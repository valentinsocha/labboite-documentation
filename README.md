## Features 

### Index

Softwares and hardware tools are organized in categories : users can quickly find the tool they looking for and the fablab can organized its tools according to their function. 

Cliking on a category display all to tools linked or lead directly to a tool page.

Admins are free to re-order the items and active or disable each element — if the tool hasn't a page.

Content of the index section is managed with a database.

### Tool page

The tools page gathers all the information to know about the tool.

User can find, dependly of the tool : 
- the tool specs
- a tutorial 
- the needed consumables
- a Q&A 
- some tips

Admins publish and update this part of the website. As the fablab has many different tools and each has its particularities, the content of the tools page adapts whether the sections are filled or not — e.g. tips section can be hidden if no tips were published.

Content of the tool page is offered for demonstration purposes for the moment.
